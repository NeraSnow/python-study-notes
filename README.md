# Python Study Notes

This is the sample code from *Python Crash Course A Hands-On, Project-Based
Introduction to Programming*. The intention of publishing these codes is for my personal convenience that I can easily refer to them. 

No copyright infringement is intended. I do not own these codes.

The official codes are available through https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/.
